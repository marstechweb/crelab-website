				<small>One of the major challenges is to use catalysis in providing benign process for chemical
					industries and in protecting the environment. The impact of our work is to scientifically create the
					fundamental knowledge on creating and designing new catalysts that can impact the processes and
					improve the existing one and optimize its efficiency and economically. The group works closely on
					numerous projects with a number of industrial partners, as well as having academic partnerships with
					the Departments of reputed universities. The CRE group is trying to mitigate the impact of waste
